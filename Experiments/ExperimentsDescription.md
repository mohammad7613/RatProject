# Experiment 1

It is pilot recording

Experiment setup:
Oddball task 100 trials 

Target and Standard 

Run with the original setting of the cavanagh and 

There are some trial for target which has abnormal duration.

200 ms duration and time interval is 2s.

Tag before and after each trial is 10 and 20 for target and standard respectively.

the sequence is loaded from the file "IADS_4_3AOB.mat" located in the "CommonFileForExepriment" 

You can see the visualization the pipeline in the following link

The basic structure of the code is located on the Experiment Folder. However, the main code is located in the computer of the rat lab in tehran university. We should bring the code and put it in the Folder Experiment1 

# Experiment 2

It is pilot recording

Experiment setup:

Oddball task 100 trials 

Target and Standard 

Run with probability distibution at each trial 0.2 for target and 0.8 for standard

There are some trial for target which has abnormal duration.

200 ms duration and time interval is 2s.

Tag before and after each trial is 10 and 20 for target and standard respectively.

# Experiment 3


It is pilot experiment

## Session 1:
Task Code File = Sharif\Codes\Mohammad\MiceTask\Tasks\AuditoryOddballTasksAssociatedWithOddor\AssociationAudioOdor
Parameter in the codes:
Number of trials = 100
Time between Audio and Odor(TIAudioOdorStimulus) = 4s, for the real time, it should be minused form the duration of aduio
OdorStimulusTime = 4s
RestTime = 8s

Lime Odor is only applied for deviant adui
Duration of adiuo is 1s
Audiu Stimulus
Tone2 is deviant 
Tone1 is standard


## Session 2:
Task Code File = Sharif\Codes\Mohammad\MiceTask\Tasks\AuditoryOddballTasksAssociatedWithOddor\AssociationAudioOdor
Parameter in the codes:
Number of trials = 100
Time between Audio and Odor(TIAudioOdorStimulus) = 3s, for the real time, it should be minused form the duration of aduio
OdorStimulusTime = 5s
RestTime = 6s

Fixed length of Total Trial = RestTime + Time between Audio and Odor

Banana Odor is only applied for deviant adui

Duration of adiuo is 1s
Audiu Stimulus
Tone2 is deviant 
Tone1 is standard
