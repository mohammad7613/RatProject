Tasks

- [x] Implement the genral code for preprocessing 
Both manual procedure(using EEGLAB GUI) and code procedures is checked.Tthe resulted EEG.datas are the same for Both.
All the codes, including the validation codes, are located in "/codes/preprocess/ConvertDataToSetFileAndPreprocess.mlx"
preprocessed Data is stored in .set file in MatData folder besides rawdata file generated by recording device. These .set file only can be used for EEG.data
How to used it:
    - Specify the path to dummy EEG data and sessionData.mat file including LFP data
    - Specify the preprocess parmaters or steps in the code and document them in Versions.md
    - Change the version integer in the code crospondingly with the previous step, a new version you have added to Version.md
    - run the preprocess section.
    - The resulted set file is going to be saved in Mat Folder along with raw data sessionData.mat
- [x] Normalized and Epoched Data
After preprocessing, the resulted data stored in a .set file is loaded and normalized through the time over each channel. The normalized data is epoched based the events
All the epoched data is stored in a struct with fields {events,data(array with shape(3,NumAllTrials,NumSamples))}. The "events" fields includes is a struct with fields trigger_index and name specifying the index of trials and the name of the event, respectively.
All the codes, including the validation codes, are located in "/codes/preprocess/Epoched.mlx".
How to use it:
    - Specify the resulted preprocessed .set file in the begining of the code
    - Load trigger info from rawdata sessionData.mat
    - Run Normalization section 
    - Specify events indexs and name
    - Run normalization section 
    - Run finally select a name and run save section.
    - The resulted set file is going to be saved in Mat Folder along with raw data sessionData.mat
- [] Run PAC and mutual Information on Epoched and normalized Data
