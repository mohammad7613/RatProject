Tasks

- [x] Implement the genral code for preprocessing 
Both manual procedure(using EEGLAB GUI) and code procedures is checked.Tthe resulted EEG.datas are the same for Both.
All the codes, including the validation codes, are located in "/codes/preprocess/ConvertDataToSetFileAndPreprocess.mlx"
preprocessed Data is stored in .set file in MatData folder besides rawdata file generated by recording device. These .set file only can be used for EEG.data
- [x] Normalized and Epoched Data
After preprocessing, the resulted data stored in a .set file is loaded and normalized through the time over each channel. The normalized data is epoched based the events
All the epoched data is stored in a struct with fields {events,data(array with shape(3,NumAllTrials,NumSamples))}. The "events" fields includes is a struct with fields trigger_index and name specifying the index of trials and the name of the event, respectively.
All the codes, including the validation codes, are located in "/codes/preprocess/Epoched.mlx".
- [] Run PAC and mutual Information on Epoched and normalized Data
