function [tf_canolty] = tfMVL(w1,w2,high_freq,low_freq)

    % This function computes the phase amplitude coupling using TF-MVL method.

    % Input:   w1, w2       : rid-rihaczek output 
    %          high_freq    : Amplitude Frequency range (single freq)
    %          low_freq     : Phase Frequency range 
    %          Fs           : Sampling Frequency  

    % Output:  tf_canolty   : Computed PAC using TF-MVL method
